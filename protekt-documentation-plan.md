#### Content Types
1. **Conceptual Content**: Explains the "why" behind features
2. **Procedural Content**: Step-by-step task completion
3. **Reference Content**: Comprehensive API documentation
4. **Troubleshooting Content**: Problem-solution pairs

### 3. User Experience Design

#### Navigation Strategy
- **Left Sidebar**: Primary navigation with clear hierarchy
- **Right Sidebar**: In-page table of contents
- **Search**: Prominent search with auto-complete
- **Breadcrumbs**: Clear path indication

#### Content Features
- **Interactive Code Examples**: Copy-paste ready code
- **API Playground**: Test endpoints directly in documentation
- **Progress Indicators**: Show completion status for multi-step guides
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Rate helpfulness, suggest improvements
